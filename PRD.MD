1. Product Overview
The application will convert video content or transcripts into structured, step-by-step guides. Users can input a URL, video file, or transcript, and the system will generate a clean, formatted document that includes timestamps for each step. Advanced features such as collaborative editing and customizable presets will be included from the outset. Multilingual transcription will be added later as an enhancement.

8. Security Considerations
Use JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.

Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS attacks or SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Implement HTTPS encryption for all communications between frontend and backend.

Rate-limit API endpoints to prevent abuse.

9. Scalability & Optimization
Use containerization (Docker) for deployment scalability across environments.

Implement caching mechanisms (Redis) to speed up frequently accessed data like presets or guides.

Optimize Whisper transcription by enabling GPU acceleration using PyTorch's CUDA backend.

Cost Optimization:
- Implement smart model selection based on user tier and requirements
- Track and optimize token usage
- Implement cost-based queue prioritization

Quality Monitoring:
- Monitor error rates across all system components
- Track guide generation success rates
- Monitor user feedback metrics
- Implement automatic alerts for quality issues

10. Testing Strategy
Write unit tests for individual components (e.g., input handling, transcription).

Perform integration tests on API endpoints and database operations.

Conduct end-to-end tests simulating full user workflows (input → processing → output).

Test scalability under high loads using tools like Apache JMeter or Locust.

11. Deployment Plan
Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipelines:

Run automated tests on every commit/pull request.

Deploy stable builds automatically to staging environments.

Deploy frontend on Vercel or Netlify for fast static site hosting.

Deploy backend on Heroku or AWS EC2 instances with Docker containers.
